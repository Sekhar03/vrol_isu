Feature: Visa Chargeback Dispute Management Workflow for Merchant, Admin, and Partner Portals
  As a portal user (Merchant, Admin, or Partner)
  I want to access my respective portal features, view dashboards, filter datasets, manage dispute lifecycles, and perform actions
  So that chargebacks are systematically handled and audited between all portals.

  Background:
    Given the Chargeback system is running
    And the following portals are available: Merchant Portal, Admin Portal, and Partner Portal

  # ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # LOGIN & AUTHENTICATION

  Scenario Outline: Portal login flow with credentials
    Given the Chargeback system is running
    When I enter my username "<Username>" and password "<Password>"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be successfully logged in with role "<Role>"
    And I should be redirected to the "<Portal>" dashboard

    Examples:
      | Username    | Password  | Role     | Portal          |
